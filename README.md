### Song Recognizer with Audio Fingerprinting

Hello! This project was the final assignment for the **Analysis of Mathematical Methods for Physics** course. We implemented an audio fingerprinting algorithm to recognize songs from a database using any audio clip of those songs.

To run the UI, first install the necessary dependencies, then execute `app.py`. The current database includes the entire *Master of Puppets* album by Metallica in `.wav` format. However, you can add any song you like; just make sure to update the pickle files by running `song_recognizer.py`.
